"""Python for Visual Effects.

Assignment #1 - Data Types and Variables

Answer the following questions.
"""

# 1.- Make a program that solves and shows the summation of 64 + 32
from os import name


print(64+32)
#test

# 2.- Do the same as the question one but this time use variables instead of 
x = 64
y = 32
sum = x + y
print(sum)
# numbers.

# 3.- Make a program that prints a sentence that includes at least 3 variables.
x = hello
y = name
z = Bunny
print(x + "my" + y + "is" +z)

# 4.- Given a sentence, assign the string to a variable then print the number of 
str = "This is my first python program"
print len(str)

# characters in the sentence. 
# The sentence is "This is my first Python program."

# 5.- Given the resolution 1920 x 1080, make a program that prints a string with 
x = (1920 * 10) / 100
y = (1080 * 10) / 100
print(" The 10% overscan of 1920 is "+ x +", and the 1080 is " + y".")
# the 10% over-scan value of those numbers. The printed string must be as 
# follows: "The 10% overscan of 1920 is <value 1>, and the 1080 is <value 2>"
